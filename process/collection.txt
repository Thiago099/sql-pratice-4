find the smallest value in the collection

smallest value starts at the first element
    
loop through the other elements of the collection

    if the current element is smaller than the smallest value
    
        set the smallest value to the current element



block
"group of sequential instructions"

expression
"single variable or mathematical expressions that returns one value"

variable
get
set

collection -> variable
length
access element

if
"executes block if expression returns true"
expression
block


foreach
"executes block for each element in a collection"
collection
iteration variable
block

for
"given range it executes block for each number on it"
start
end
step
iteration variable



when the for is linked to the magic variable length it assumes another meaning
