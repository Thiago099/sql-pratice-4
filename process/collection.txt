find the smallest value in the collection

smallest value starts at the first element
    
loop through the other elements of the collection

    if the current element is smaller than the smallest value
    
        set the smallest value to the current element



block
"group of sequential instructions"

expression
"single variable or mathematical expressions that returns one value"

variable
"stores the value until it is set again"
#get
#set

collection -> variable
"sequential group of variables"
#access element
length

if
"executes block if expression returns true"

foreach
"executes block for each element in a collection, and provides it to the block"

for
"given range it executes block for each number on it, and provides it to the block"
start

while
"executes block until the expression returns true"

function
"the function once defined it can be called providing any parameters it require, and returns a value"

parameters
return


when the for is linked to the magic variable length it assumes another meaning
the parameters of a process alter its meaning
